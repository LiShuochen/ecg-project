| **Project Title** | Cardiac Arrhythmia Classification |
| **Project Description** | Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Clinical and preclinical research into the development of effective therapies is hindered by the lack of objective definitions of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. The aim of this project is to develop deep neural network structures and/or ECG signal representation for accurate detection and classification of ventricular arrhythmias. The project can take several different directions depending on the type of neural network and the input features. |
| **Deliverables** | A deep neural network architecture and an input representation for accurate classification of cardiac arrhythmias |
